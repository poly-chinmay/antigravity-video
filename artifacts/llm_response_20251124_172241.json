Review clip duration and content for potential gaps or duplicates.\n3. Determine a preferred video structure (e.g., chronological order, narrative flow).\n4. Assess existing audio tracks and decide on their inclusion in the final edit.\n5. Create a rough outline of the desired edit plan, considering pacing, tone, and key moments.\n\nReasoning:\n\n* To create a complete edit plan, I will need to import all available clips into the timeline first.\n* Without any existing clips, it is impossible to proceed with creating an edit plan.\n* The preferred video structure should be determined based on the content of the imported clips.\n\nPlease confirm before proceeding.",
