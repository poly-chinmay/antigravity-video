  "content": "Creating an initial edit plan based on the provided context:\n\n1. Generate a complete list of all existing clips.\n2. Assess each clip's content, duration, and relevance to the project.\n3. Prioritize clips for inclusion in the final edit, considering factors such as story progression, pacing, and emotional impact.\n4. Identify any gaps or inconsistencies within the current clips.\n5. Develop a preliminary sequence plan that maintains chronological order while making adjustments for optimal flow and narrative coherence.\n\nInitial Edit Plan:\n\n1. Clip A (ID: 12345) - Included in the final edit with high priority due to its central role in the story.\n2. Clip B (ID: 67890) - Included, but with lower priority, as it provides supporting context without disrupting the narrative flow.\n3. Clip C (ID: 11111) - Identified as a potential outlier and candidate for re-evaluation or removal.\n\nReasoning: The initial edit plan focuses on establishing a solid foundation by prioritizing essential clips while leaving room for further refinement. Further analysis will be necessary to finalize the sequence plan, taking into account factors such as pacing, tone, and overall narrative cohesion.",
