However, I can try to help you find a clip from God of War (2018) online.\n\nThere are many hilarious moments in the game, but I'll provide you with some popular ones that might be considered \"random\" clips:\n\n1. **Kratos' reactions**: In one scene, Kratos is exploring a Viking village and he stumbles upon a longhouse. He looks around and says: \"This is not what I expected.\" Another time, he's in a forest, and he sees a giant eagle, which makes him exclaim: \"What...in the name of Odin?\"\n2. **Fenrir's tantrum**: When Kratos is fighting Fenrir (the World Serpent), the beast gets so angry that it starts shouting and flailing around. The clip shows this intense moment, with some funny facial expressions from Fenrir.\n3. **Atreus' frustration**: During a quest, Atreus (Kratos' son) becomes frustrated with Kratos for not explaining what's going on. This leads to some amusing moments of Atreus rolling his eyes and muttering under his breath.\n\nIf you're interested in finding these clips online, I recommend searching for \"God of War (2018) funny moments\" or \"God of War memes.\" You can also try watching Let's Plays or walkthroughs of the game on YouTube or other platforms.",
